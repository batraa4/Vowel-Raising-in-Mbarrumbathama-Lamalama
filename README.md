# Vowel-Raising-in-Mbarrumbathama-Lamalama
Phonology (Vowel Raising) in Mbarrumbathama Lamalama. In this language there seems to be a very wide use of vowels but only three phonemes /i, a, u/  and two diphthongs /ia, ua/ (Verstraete, 2019). In this paper I will investigate the rules for second  vowel raising in diphthongs and vowel raising following glides [w, j]. Since it is also acceptable  to replace the first vowel with a glide [j, w] in diphthongs (Verstraete, 2019), I will explore rule  ordering within regards to how vowels are raised in diphthongs. Whether they first raise because  of the [i, u] preceding it, or the [j, w]. Please see my other paper for the phonetics of this language.
